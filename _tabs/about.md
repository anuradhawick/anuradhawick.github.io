- I was ranked 68th all-island (4th in entire district) in my Advanced Level examination in physical sciences stream.

### I am Originally from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 I Love to Travel 🏝

My hometown is located in Gampaha District a small non-urban town. I was grown eating grass and mud, playing with my brother and neighbouring kids. A simple village life that wasn't rural and definitely wasn't urban. Even to date, I am inspired by simple livelihoods that leave plenty of time to free thought and creativity. 

Now that my wife and I both are stuyding in Australia, we roam around the continent whenever we have a chance.
