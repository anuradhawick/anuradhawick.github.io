### I am Originally from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 I Love to Travel 🏝

My hometown is located in Gampaha District a small non-urban town. I was grown eating grass and mud, playing with my brother and neighbouring kids. A simple village life that wasn't rural and definitely wasn't urban. Even to date, I am inspired by simple livelihoods that leave plenty of time to free thought and creativity. 

My wife and I love to travel and we have our own travel blog. Click the following logo to see 🏝
