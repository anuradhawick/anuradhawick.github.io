There are few software that I have developed to help me with my work. Some have been so helpful, that I have made them available to other collegues for use. I hope you try few of these and possible give some feedback. Even better, use them in your work. ðŸ˜ƒ

## MetaBCC-LR
![MetaBCC-LR logo](https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR/raw/master/MetaBCC-LR_logo.png)

This is the first long read binner that is 100% reference-free and to use both coverage and composition for binning. 

This piece of work has been presented at ISMB 2020 and published in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa441). 

Code is available at [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR).

## LRBinner

Accepted for presentation at [WABI 2021](http://www.acm-bcb.org/WABI/2021/) soon to be published at [LIPICS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/institut_lipics.php)

<hr/>

## PlasLR
![PlasLR logo](https://github.com/anuradhawick/PlasLR/raw/master/PlasLR_logo.png)

This tool facilitates extension of plasmid classification for long reads. Classification of plasmids before assembly of long reads have proven to improve quality of assembled plasmids and chromosomes.

Presented at [GLBIO 2021](https://www.iscb.org/glbio2021)

Code availalbe at [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/PlasLR)

## GraphPlas

This tool enables improvement of plasmid classification of NGS assemblies using assembly graph. 

Work has been presented at [APBC 2021](http://www.binfo.ncku.edu.tw/APBC2021/index.html) published in [IEEE TCBB](https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2021.3082915)

# Software for Machine Learning

<hr/>

## Seq2Vec

Most Bioinformatics machine learning tasks rely on oligonucleotide frequency vectors. They were so frequently used in my work that I decided to make an efficient tool myself for the task. This helps me to re-use code in a highly modular fashion. Hope this will help someone else as well;

Code in [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/seq2vec/blob/main/README.md)

## Object Annotation Maker

Object annotations for computer vision is a tedius task. However, more often we have object images with white backgrounds. In this tool; you get to pick object images and desired backgrounds for image generation. There are many parameters that one can use to generate a large dataset of images for computer vision tasks.
