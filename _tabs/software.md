There are few software that I have developed to help me with my work. Some have been so helpful, that I have made them available to other collegues for use. I hope you try few of these and possible give some feedback. Even better, use them in your work. ðŸ˜ƒ

## MetaBCC-LR
<img src="https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR/raw/master/MetaBCC-LR_logo.png" alt="MetaBCC-LR logo" style="width:300px;"/>

This is the first long read binner that is 100% reference-free and to use both coverage and composition for binning. 

This piece of work has been presented at ISMB 2020 and published in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa441){:target="_blank"}. 

Code is available at [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/MetaBCC-LR){:target="_blank"}.

This tool facilitates extension of plasmid classification for long reads. Classification of plasmids before assembly of long reads have proven to improve quality of assembled plasmids and chromosomes.

# Software for Machine Learning

<hr/>

## Seq2Vec

Most Bioinformatics machine learning tasks rely on oligonucleotide frequency vectors. They were so frequently used in my work that I decided to make an efficient tool myself for the task. This helps me to re-use code in a highly modular fashion. Hope this will help someone else as well;

Code in [Github](https://github.com/anuradhawick/seq2vec/){:target="_blank"}

## Object Annotation Maker

Object annotations for computer vision is a tedius task. However, more often we have object images with white backgrounds. In this tool; you get to pick object images and desired backgrounds for image generation. There are many parameters that one can use to generate a large dataset of images for computer vision tasks.

This is a small hobby project where I built a small clock using M5 Stick C Plus which is a cute little WiFi enabled IOT device.

## MQTT Door Sensor

A power efficient, fast and response door sensor implementation that is 100% compatible with Home Assistant. This is essentially a template and can be edited at will to derive a completely different Home Assistant compatible IOT device.

## AWS Lambda Boilerplate

A simple, robus and lightweight boilerplate that is highly extensible in large scale AWS lambda projects. This has proven success in [Vinyl.LK](https://www.vinyl.lk){:target="_blank"} which is an online catalogue of Sri Lankan vinyl records.
